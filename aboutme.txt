#### 1. **Collaboration and Cross-Functional Support**
This year, I made collaboration across teams and departments a key focus:

Whether helping a colleague explore other domains or supporting the **Arrow launch**, I ensured that each interaction was built on clear communication and teamwork.

- **Stakeholder Engagement**: I maintained open communication with both internal and external stakeholders to ensure alignment on project goals, especially for strategic projects like **Account Closures** and **Balance Transfers**. This helped avoid last-minute surprises and ensured smooth deliveries.

#### 2. **Leadership and Empowerment**
As a VP of Engineering, I prioritized leadership that empowered my team to succeed:
- **Leading by Example**: I took ownership of complex tasks, such as upgrading to **Java 17**, **Spring Boot 3**, and **Python 3.11**, setting a high standard for technical excellence. This inspired the team to take initiative in their areas of responsibility.
- **Empowering Others**: I provided opportunities for team members to take on challenging roles, helping them grow professionally. I also supported colleagues emotionally by guiding them through HR policies during tough times, ensuring they felt supported both personally and professionally.
- **Delegation and Trust**: By encouraging team members to take ownership of different components, such as **Context-Based Eligibility Checks**, I built a culture of trust, allowing individuals to contribute their best work while I offered guidance and feedback when needed.

#### 3. **Innovation and Problem-Solving**
I consistently pushed for innovation and addressed challenges with a proactive mindset:
- **Innovative Thinking**: I developed the **Environment Compatibility Checker Utility**, which identified gaps in production environments and drastically reduced time spent troubleshooting. This was a clear example of my commitment to proactive problem-solving.
- **Analytical Approach**: Whether driving improvements through the **Behavioral Design Development Process** or solving system issues through performance upgrades, I used a data-driven approach to make decisions. This led to measurable improvements, including smoother operations in **Payments**, **Auth**, and **ATD**.
- **Process Improvement**: Facilitating workshops on production queries and log generation helped us identify and solve critical system bottlenecks, improving the team’s ability to respond quickly to system failures and enhancing overall system reliability.

#### 4. **Adaptability and Resilience**
This year brought several challenges, but I embraced each one with resilience and adaptability:
- **Extended Efforts**: During the launch of **Arrow**, I extended hours to meet deadlines and provided critical support to ensure smooth delivery, demonstrating my adaptability in high-pressure situations.
- **Balancing Multiple Priorities**: I managed multiple high-impact projects, such as **Account Closures**, **Balance Transfers**, and **Self-Serve Decommissioning**, all while contributing to performance improvement efforts and facilitating workshops. I balanced these responsibilities without compromising on quality, which underscores my ability to prioritize and remain adaptable.
- **Continuous Learning**: Registering for the **Book Club** and participating in citizenship initiatives reflects my commitment to personal growth and contributing to the broader community, which helps me remain adaptable in different settings.

#### 5. **Inclusivity and Team Well-Being**
I prioritized inclusivity and the well-being of my team to ensure a positive work environment:
- **Emotional Support**: Supporting colleagues during tough personal situations by referring to HR policies and offering guidance showed my commitment to their well-being. I believe that a strong, emotionally supported team is a more productive and loyal one.
- **Diversity of Thought**: Encouraging colleagues to work in other domains and supporting their aspirations ensured that each team member felt included and valued. This also enriched the diversity of thought within our team, leading to more innovative solutions.

#### 6. **Customer and Business Focus**
Throughout the year, I remained focused on delivering value to both the customer and the business:
- **Customer-Centric Solutions**: I led several customer-facing projects, such as the **Balance Transfer Journey**, **Account Closure**, and **Account Onboarding**, ensuring that our solutions were seamless and met customer needs. I regularly solicited feedback from stakeholders to keep our projects aligned with business priorities.
- **Efficiency and Cost-Saving**: By leading the **Self-Serve Decommissioning** and **Account Sale Guarding** initiatives, I contributed to reducing operational overhead and technical debt, keeping our systems lean and efficient.
  
#### 7. **Ethical Responsibility and Integrity**
In all my efforts, I maintained a high level of integrity:
